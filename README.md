# British Airways Data Science & Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains my work for the British Airways Data Science simulation on Forage. The project covers two main areas:
1. **Predictive Modeling:** Predicting customer booking behavior.
2. **Operational Analytics:** Analysis of lounge eligibility and flight scheduling.

## Key Results
- **Booking Prediction:** Developed a Random Forest model with **84.9% accuracy**.
- **Lounge Analysis:** Created a dynamic lookup model to predict lounge demand based on flight haul (Long/Short) and time of day.
- **Top Predictive Drivers:** Purchase Lead, Flight Hour, and Length of Stay.

## Tools Used
- **Python:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib (for Machine Learning).
- **Excel:** Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, and Data Visualization (for Lounge & Schedule analysis).
- **Presentation:** PowerPoint for executive summary.

## Repository Content
### Machine Learning (Task 2)
- `Getting Started.ipynb`: Full Python code for data cleaning, modeling, and evaluation.
- `Customer_Booking_Prediction_Presentation.pptx`: Final slide for management.

### Operational Analytics (Task 1)
- `Lounge_Eligibility_Analysis.xlsx`: Model for predicting lounge access (Tier 1, 2, and 3).
- `British_Airways_Summer_Schedule.xlsx`: Analysis of the summer flight dataset including passenger volume and haul types.
- `Justification_Report.csv`: Detailed explanation of the logic used for passenger grouping.

## Strategic Recommendations
- **Targeting:** Focus marketing efforts on high-intent "Purchase Lead" segments.
- **Lounge Management:** Optimize staffing in lounges during "Long-Haul Morning" and "Short-Haul Evening" peaks as identified in the analysis.
